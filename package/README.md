# Nordic Thingy:52 Node.js library

Welcome to the Nordic Thingy:52 Node.js library example.
Please see http://www.nordicsemi.com/thingy for the latest Nordic Thingy:52 news and software releases.

This library is using [noble-device](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble-device) and [noble](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble) to handle the Bluetooth connection.


> See [RASPBERRYPI.md](https://github.com/NordicPlayground/Nordic-Thingy52-Nodejs/blob/master/RASPBERRYPI.md) for how to set it up on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian.

> See [GOOGLE_ASSISTANT.md](https://github.com/NordicPlayground/Nordic-Thingy52-Nodejs/blob/master/GOOGLE_ASSISTANT.md) for how to set it up on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian and Google Assistant using the Thingy:52 as microphone input.
